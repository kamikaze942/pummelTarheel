The following file killunc2.py,  is a game dedicated to my hatred of UNC Chapel hill.  

Concept was originally taken from Pummel the Chimp, this readme2.txt file was made after the original killunc.py
which was missing certain features.    

Here are the changes from the original pummel the chimp game.  

1.  Changed background to 640x480.

2.  Added cameron indoor stadium as background image.

3.  Replaced fist from 'pummel the chimp' to a black fist, representing Gerald Henderson. 

4.  Replaced Chimp graphic to Tyler Hansbrough, one of the most hated UNC players

5.  Replaced text with "Youve pummeled the tarheel (however many) times"

6.  Made Tyler Hansbrough's face shrink with every sucessive hit (1-5).

7.  Changed Sound effects to make Tyler Hansbrough cry like a girl everytime he was hit, 
and the 'miss' sound is homer simpson's 'doh!'

8.  Put timer in bottom right, and game ends at 3 minutes.

9.  Window title has changed to 'pummel the tarheel'

10.  Allows for Quit(q) and Restart(e) by pressing the appropriate keys in the parenthesis.  I wasn't sure about what to
do with the replay.   I read all of the lessons and installed python and pygame.
